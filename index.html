          According to The Gender Snapshot 2022 report, it will take around 300 years to reach gender equality. If countries do not make significant progress, the world won't achieve Sustainable Development Goal #5 by 2030. The report highlights the gender gaps in various areas such as education, employment, and political representation.

              Gender-equitable education systems empower girls and boys and promote the development of life skills like self-management, communication, negotiation and critical thinking that young people need to succeed. They close skills gaps that perpetuate pay gaps, and build prosperity for entire countries.
              <br>
              Gender-equitable education systems can contribute to reductions in school-related gender-based violence and harmful practices, including child marriage and female genital mutilation.

              Addressing imbalances and discrimination that men and women may experience in the informal labor market is the goal of gender equality in employment. Women are disproportionately represented in the informal economy in various regions. This can be ascribed to a number of things, including the fact that women have less access to education and training opportunities, cultural norms that limit their participation in particular industries, and a lack of legislation and policies that are supportive of them.

              A number of figures are commonly used to describe the gender wage gap. One often-cited statistic comes from the Census Bureau, which looks at annual pay of full-time workers. By that measure, women are paid 80 cents for every dollar men are paid. Another measure looks at hourly pay and does not exclude part-time workers. It finds that, relative to men, typical women are paid 83 cents on the dollar. Other, less-cited measures show different gaps because they examine the gap at different parts of the wage distribution, or for different demographic subgroups, or are adjusted for factors such as education level and occupation.

              The gender composition of public administrations and parliaments is crucial for ensuring fairness and responsiveness. Achieving gender equality in politics requires equal access to positions and participation in decision-making. This involves inclusive work environments, equal leadership roles, and removing socio-economic barriers. In 2021, 31.6% of lower/single house parliament seats were held by women, compared to 26% a decade ago. However, significant setbacks occurred in Slovenia, Iceland, and Germany. A gender-balanced cabinet is a strong indicator of a government's commitment to gender equality. In 2021, 34% of federal/central government ministerial positions were held by women, an increase of 6 percentage points since 2017. Countries like Spain, Finland, France, Austria, Belgium, and the United States have also seen notable gains in women's representation.

              Racialized gender is a sociological concept that refers to the critical analysis of the simultaneous effects of race and gender processes on individuals, families, and communities. This concept recognizes that women do not negotiate race and gender similarly. For instance, white women's oppression has been linked with their privilege as white people, but they have not escaped the bonds of sexism. Black women's and First Nation women's oppression has been linked to the struggle of self-definition, agency, and collective empowerment. Latina and Asian women's oppression has been linked more to sexism emerging from immigration and multigenerational experiences. Historical, social, and geographic context influence the expression, interpretation, and performance of gender relations over the life span of an individual. Multiracial feminists and ethnic scholars have written extensively about racialized gender particularly as it relates to social constructions of family and sexuality.
